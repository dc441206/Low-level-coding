# Low-level-coding
Low level coding skill share

The idea is to work your way through it; finish each step before you move on to the next ...The idea is to introduce you to some rarely-trodden paths, and guide you in to traversing them one-or-two steps at a time.

I've tried very hard not to put spoilers for earlier challenges in later challenges, but ultimately that's going to prove nigh-impossible.

However, even if you 'just read it'â„¢, you will probably pick up a thing or two, but you will miss out on developing intuition for where bugs will be.

Whatever you choose; have fun :)
