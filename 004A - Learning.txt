 What You've Learned
=====================

# If you don't tell your compiler to keep you informed about well-known
  programming mistakes ...It won't!
  ...and sooner-or-later you WILL regret not making the most of your compiler!
  ...Or, more to the point: The manufacturer of the device you are hacking is
     about to start wishing THEY had made the most of THEIR compiler.

# You know that envp is the third argument to main() - most people don't
  If, as an attacker, you manage to get control of this variable,
  you get to see some of the server configuration.

# You know how to use library functions, 
  and make sure you request the right ones.
  ...Rather than leave it to the compiler to decide,
     and just "hope" it chooses the one you expected!

# You know how to tell the compiler that you KNOW there is an unused variable
  in your code, and you have actively decided that it is acceptable.
