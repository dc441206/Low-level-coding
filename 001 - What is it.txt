OK. Let's get this show on the road...

This share will be a guide to low-level programming
As such, we will be using a Linux command line, and coding in C.

We will use *TRIVIAL* programming demos and challenges to show how easy it is 
to write potentially fatal security flaws, and how to spot these mistakes in
other people's code.

The focus is to be HOW a program WORKS.  This will mean learning about, 
amongst other things, how the Stack, Heap, and Pointers work.

(  What's the target skill level?  )
 `--------------------------------'

It is expected that your current programming skill is good enough to write
a program (in ANY language of your choice) that will play "fizz buzz"

Fizz Buzz:
	loop through all the numbers from 1 to 100
	if the number is divisible by 3       print "fizz"
	if the number is divisible by 5       print "buzz"
	if the number is divisible by both    print "fizz buzz"
	if the number is divisible by neither print the number
