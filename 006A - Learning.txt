=====================
 What You've Learned
=====================

If you actually understand** the code you've just written, then:

# You've learned the difference between constant pointers and constant data

...It might not seem much - and you might not realise it yet - 
   but you are getting your first glimpse of how programs use your RAM chips,
   something MANY programmers, and MOST developers have no understading of.

** If you just:
   a) kept trying differernt combinations until you got lucky
   or b) cut'n'paste it from "somewhere"
   ...Then you probably didn't learn anything of any great value.
      But do take consolation with the "$kr1pt-k1dd13" badge of "Yay. Me lucky"
