Do you have access to a Linux PC/VM/server/etc.?

Yes? Great. Go down to the bit about installing packages.

No? You are going to need one.

Options include:
# Cygwin - a bit old-skool now
# WSL - and choose: Debian
# Install Debain on an old laptop - any working laptop will be powerful enough
# Install VirtualBox and find an official Debian Image for it
# Raspberry Pi (any except "Pico")

If you think Arch or Gentoo is better than Debian, go for it
...but bear in mind, you will be on-your-own if you run in to problems.

You will NOT *require* a desktop (such as GNOME or KDE) - but you may like 
to use one ...I do not use one, so again, problems here are out of scope.

(  Install Packages  )
 `------------------'

In Debian. At the command prompt. As root. Type:
	apt-get update
	apt-get upgrade
	apt-get install build-essential

If you are NOT using Debian, you may need to cast a different incantation to 
install the packages included in Debian's build-essential toolkit.  pacman?
