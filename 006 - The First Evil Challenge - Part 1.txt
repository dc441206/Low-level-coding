(  The First Evil Challenge  )
 `--------------------------'

There are, essentially, two ways you could have cracked challenge #2

Either with an integer value {int, long, long long, unsigned char, ...}
Or with a pointer/indirection (anything with a *)

Given my target audience, I am going to assume you used an 'int'
Ie. You DIDN'T opt to try and do it with a double-indirection pointer
    ...If you did ...Kudos! :) ...Try doing it with an 'int' loop ;)

(  Evil - Part 1  )
 `---------------'

Make a copy of your latest code:  `cp  hello2a.c  evil1.c`

Declare a variable called 'ptr' which can hold a copy of 'envp'
...and put a copy of 'envp' in it.

You line will look like this:
	________ ptr = envp;

** You MAY NOT edit ANY part of the first line:
		int  main (...)

We will NOT use this variable in Part 1, 
...remember to tell the compiler this is deliberate!
	
Compile your program (with Error Checking enabled!) [[see above]]

...We do not need to run this to test it. If it compiles, you got it right!
